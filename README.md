# 2D Games with Unity in F#

My work through the 2D games with unity book by Apress, but using F# instead of C#

Why? I just prefer the syntax of F#, and its fully compatible with the rest of the .NET runtime. Any functional advantages of F# over C# in the Unity space are probably minimal due to the nature of how Unity code works.
